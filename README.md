Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) pose a significant challenge to healthcare systems 
globally, necessitating effective predictive models for disease recurrence. This study 
focuses on leveraging machine learning algorithms to address the complex task of 
predicting CVD recurrence based on patient data. 
Our approach began with assembling a comprehensive dataset encompassing 
demographic variables (age, gender) and critical medical history indicators (diabetes, 
smoking status, history of atrial fibrillation, past cardiovascular events, and treatment 
details). Preprocessing steps were vital, including handling missing values, encoding 
categorical variables, and feature selection to ensure data quality and model accuracy. 
Three machine learning algorithms were evaluated: Gaussian Naive Bayes, Support 
Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest were taken into consideration. 
Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used for 
evaluation, supplemented by visualizations like confusion matrices and ROC curves. 
Notably, we initially explored a hybrid model approach but found that individual 
implementations of algorithms outperformed the hybrid model in predicting CVD 
recurrence. 
Among the algorithms tested, Random Forest emerged as the most effective, 
showcasing superior predictive accuracy and robustness. Our findings underline the 
potential of machine learning in healthcare, especially in risk stratification and 
personalized interventions for CVD management. 
In conclusion, this study demonstrates the efficacy of machine learning algorithms in 
predicting CVD recurrence. The methodology employed, from data preprocessing to 
model selection and evaluation, offers a systematic framework for leveraging machine 
learning in healthcare contexts. Moving forward, these insights can guide the 
development of more targeted and proactive strategies for managing cardiovascular 
health, benefiting both patients and healthcare providers.
